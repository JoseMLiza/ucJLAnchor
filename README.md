# ucJLAnchor

ucJLAnchor is a user control that allows you to set fixed or percentage coordinates to the controls of a form, making it easier to resize them. We can also define the minimum and maximum height and width of the parent form.

Consider that when establishing the maximum height and width, the measurements of the screen will be evaluated so that the maximize button of the parent form is deactivated.

This control can be used in child forms of an MDIForm.

As always, it will be appreciated if an error is reported to provide the necessary solution.
